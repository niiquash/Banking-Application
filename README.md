# Overview

This is a java project I built to teach myself the Java programming language

Basically, this simple banking app allows a user to create an account and make deposits and withdrawals.
I implemented this using a Main class and an Account class.

I wrote this software to teach myself the principles of object oriented programming and its benefits.

Here's a link to the demo of the software:
